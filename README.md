OffPDF is a free, MIT-licensed desktop toolbox for everyday PDF work. It uses
local engines such as qpdf, Poppler, Tesseract, and LibreOffice, with no cloud
service in the middle.

## Why OffPDF?

- **Private by design.** No uploads, accounts, analytics, telemetry, or remote API.
- **Useful offline.** Install it once and keep working without a connection.
- **One focused toolbox.** Organize, convert, compress, OCR, protect, and repair PDFs.
- **Open and inspectable.** The app and its privacy model are available here under MIT.

## 23 PDF tools

| Organize | Convert | Optimize & secure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merge PDFs | Office / HTML to PDF | Compress PDF |
| Split PDF | PDF to Office | Protect PDF |
| Organize pages | PDF to images | Unlock PDF |
| Page numbers | OCR (make searchable) | Repair PDF |
| Watermark | PDF/A (archive) | Edit metadata |
| Crop pages | PDF to text | |
| Stamp / Sign | | |
| Edit PDF | | |
| Poster / tile print | | |
| N-up / Booklet | | |
| Compare PDFs | | |
| Remove blank pages | | |

### Edit PDF capabilities

The Edit PDF workspace adds text, images, shapes, links, and freehand drawing as
new content. It can also create PDF notes, highlights, underlines, strikeouts,
and ink annotations while preserving existing annotations.

For interactive PDFs, OffPDF can fill existing AcroForm text fields (including
multiline fields), checkboxes, radio buttons, combo boxes, and list boxes. Form
fields stay interactive by default.

The two flattening options have different scopes:

- **Flatten form fields** turns supported form widgets into page content while
  leaving other annotations interactive.
- **Flatten annotations** turns all remaining annotations into non-interactive
  page content. When a PDF contains form fields, OffPDF requires form fields to
  be flattened as part of this operation.

Current limits: XFA forms are not supported; only the first PDF's AcroForm can
be filled when several files are combined; and Edit PDF does not rewrite text
or images already embedded in a source page. New text and images are added as
overlays instead.

## Downloads

| Platform | Package | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | [Download from the latest release](https://github.com/McanKul/offpdf/releases/latest) | Available on GitHub Releases; currently unsigned while Authenticode signing is completed |
| macOS 11+ · Apple Silicon | [Download from the latest release](https://github.com/McanKul/offpdf/releases/latest) | Signed and notarized |
| Intel Mac / Linux | [Build from source](#development) | No published package yet |

The Windows installer is large because it includes the local engines needed to
keep its core workflows offline. The macOS build bundles qpdf, Poppler, and
Tesseract; LibreOffice is optional and only needed for Office and PDF/A tools.
Until Authenticode signing is complete, the Windows package is distributed only
through GitHub Releases and is not linked from offpdf.com.

All published binaries are available on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/McanKul/offpdf/releases).

See the [code signing policy](./CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md) for how official release
artifacts are built, approved, and verified.

## Open With (desktop)

A packaged build registers OffPDF as an **Open With** handler for the same types
the in-app picker already accepts (PDF, images including HEIC/HEIF, and Office).
It is not the silent default PDF app (`bundle.fileAssociations` uses
`rank: Alternate`). Choose OffPDF from Finder, Explorer, or your Linux file
manager.

Opened files go into the existing workspace. No merge, compress, convert, or
redact job starts until you pick a tool. If OffPDF is already running, the
existing window is focused and the files are added there.

Association metadata lives in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Full Finder/Explorer
clicks need a packaged build (`npm run tauri:build`) or a local `tauri:dev`
session plus a manual OS association.

## Privacy model

- Documents are processed by local binaries on your machine.
- Preview, search, and editing may pass locally generated page data, thumbnails,
  or extracted text to the bundled interface. This data stays inside the app.
- There is no account system, cloud sync, analytics, telemetry, or remote API.
- The production app uses Tauri's local custom protocol and a restrictive CSP.
- Auto-update is not enabled.

See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) for the plain-language privacy statement.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust via `rustup`
- [Tauri v2 platform prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
- `qpdf` for core PDF operations
- Optional: Poppler, Tesseract, and LibreOffice for the tools listed below

```bash
# macOS
brew install qpdf poppler tesseract
brew install --cask libreoffice

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install qpdf poppler-utils tesseract-ocr libreoffice
```

Install dependencies and run the desktop app:

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

Run the checks used by CI:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

Create a desktop bundle:

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

### Local engines

| Engine | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `qpdf` | Merge, split, organize, encrypt, decrypt, repair, and lossless optimization |
| Poppler (`pdftoppm`, `pdftotext`) | Previews, image export, comparison, text export, and lossy compression |
| Tesseract | OCR and searchable PDFs |
| LibreOffice | Office conversion and PDF/A export |
